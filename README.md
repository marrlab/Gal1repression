## Summary

Cells must continuously adjust to changing environments and, thus, have evolved mechanisms allowing them to respond to repeated stimuli. While faster gene induction upon a repeated stimulus is known as reinduction memory, responses to repeated repression have been less studied so far.
Here, we studied gene repression across repeated carbon source shifts in over 1,500 single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. By monitoring the expression of a carbon source-responsive gene, galactokinase 1 (Gal1), and fitting a mathematical model to the single-cell data, we observed a faster response upon repeated repressions at the population level. Exploiting our single-cell data and quantitative modeling approach, we discovered that the faster response is mediated by a shortened repression response delay, the estimated time between carbon source shift and Gal1 protein production termination. Interestingly, we can exclude two alternative hypotheses, i) stronger dilution because of e.g., increased proliferation, and ii) a larger fraction of repressing cells upon repeated repressions.
Collectively, our study provides a quantitative description of repression kinetics in single cells and allows us to pinpoint potential mechanisms underlying a faster response upon repeated repression. The computational results of our study can serve as the starting point for experimental follow-up studies. <br>

Required software and toolboxes:

- MATLAB (R2017b)

The analysis was performed on a macOS Big Sur version 11.4. <br>

## Folder Structure

Here you can find the list of all folders contained in this repository:

- [Data](Data)
- [Figures](Figures)
- [Functions](Functions)
- [Results](Results)
- [Segmentation](Segmentation)
- [Tools](Tools)

## How to run the code

The important scripts are (i) [main_script.m](main_script.m) for running the workflow containing the data preprocessing, parameter estimation and statistical analysis (see Workflow) and (ii) plotFigureX.m to plot the single figure panels of figure X (see Figures).

## Segmentation

The raw MATLAB structures containing the information extracted from segmenting single budding yeast cells can be found in the folder [Segmentation](Segmentation), where the file name ExpX_posY_Z_A summarizes: X - experiment name, Y - position, Z - strain, A - strain name. 

## Data

Single cell information important for our analysis (namely cell ID, mother cell ID, detection frame, relative GFP intensities per time and cell area per time) was extracted and summarized in MATLAB structures named SExpX_posY_Z_A according to their raw MATLAB files in [Segmentation](Segmentation). The MATLAB structure containing the total GFP of all computed non-dividing cells, can also be found in the folder [Data](Data). 

## Workflow

The workflow to the whole manuscript can be found in the script [main_script.m](main_script.m).

## Figures
plotFigureX.m scripts recreate all figure panels of figure X. The created figure files as pdfs are saved to and can be found in the folder [Figures](Figures). You can also find the full figures in this folder. 

## Functions
All functions used by the [main_script.m](main_script.m) can be found here. More information on the functions can be found in the scripts themselves eg. input, output. 

## Tools
Both toolboxes, PESTO - Parameter EStimation TOolbox - and phyloCell, used in this analyis can be found here. 

## Results 
All outputs generated by the [main_script.m](main_script.m) apart from the data structures are saved here eg. estimated parameters for each total GFP trace for repressions 1 and 2 as well as the outputs of the statistical analysis and simulation study.
